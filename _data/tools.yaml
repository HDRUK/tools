  description: 'The aim of this project is to develop a database of simulated pulse
    waves with which to test pulse wave analysis algorithms.


    A database of simulated pulse waves representative of a sample of healthy adults
    was created. It contains several types of pulse waves (such as those measured
    by smart watches and fitness trackers) at common measurement sites for 4,374 virtual
    subjects aged 25 - 75 years old. The virtual subjects exhibit a range of cardiovascular
    properties across the normal ranges encountered in healthy people. The results
    were verified against in vivo data. Case studies were published (at https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019
    ) demonstrating the utility of the database.


    The database is a useful resource for research and education on the topics of:
    signal processing, physiology, and computational modelling.'

  description: 'Cytel Inc. has launched an open-access global COVID-19 Clinical Trial
    Tracker to help facilitate greater collaboration between researchers, policymakers,
    clinicians, journalists, philanthropists, and other critical stakeholders who
    need to understand the complex dynamics of the global response to finding a solution
    to the COVID-19 outbreak.


    This will enable them to make more informed and pragmatic decisions on how to
    channel scarce resources. Clinicians and local government need to know what trials
    are taking place in their community to ensure that the right patients receive
    the right exploratory treatment, while philanthropists and Federal policymakers
    deserve a one-stop shop to determine which are the most promising early phase
    treatment results.


    Funded in part by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a leader in global health
    solutions, this live dashboard offers an overview of all the trials taking place
    in the international effort to tackle the pandemic. One of the most difficult
    challenges facing those seeking a COVID-19 treatment is how little data exists
    about this disease. Early investigators are relying on guesswork to determine
    which therapies to investigate. Collating information in one place on the growing
    numbers of trials, will enable decision-makers to compare treatments more easily
    as they determine which to investigate further.'

    Easy-to-use visual environment for predictive analytics. No programming required.
    RapidMiner is easily the most powerful and intuitive graphical user interface
    for the design of analysis processes. Forget sifting through code! You can also
    choose to run in batch mode. Whatever you prefer, RapidMiner has it all.


    RapidMiner Python package:

    Both Studio and Server classes provide a read and a write method for reading /
    writing data and other objects, and a run method to run processes. The method
    signatures are the same, with somewhat different extra parameters.


    Studio class requires a local Studio installation and is suitable in the following
    cases:


    Implementing certain data science steps in Python using your favorite IDE or notebook
    implementation. You may even use the resulting code afterwards in a RapidMiner
    process within an Execute Python operator.

    You are using coding primarily, but you want to incorporate methods that are impemented
    in a RapidMiner process.

    Creating batch tasks that also interact with the repository and / or run processes.

    Server class connects directly to a Server instance without the need of a Studio
    installation. It is suitable in the following cases:


    Collaborating with RapidMiner users, sharing data easily.

    Calling, running, scheduling processes on the RapidMiner Server platform from
    a local script.'

    Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for solving real-world data
    mining problems. It is written in Java and runs on almost any platform. The algorithms
    can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code.


    Weka is tried and tested open source machine learning software that can be accessed
    through a graphical user interface, standard terminal applications, or a Java
    API. It is widely used for teaching, research, and industrial applications, contains
    a plethora of built-in tools for standard machine learning tasks, and additionally
    gives transparent access to well-known toolboxes such as scikit-learn, R, and
    Deeplearning4j.


    Weka contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis
    and predictive modelling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access
    to these functions.


    Weka supports several standard data mining tasks, more specifically, data preprocessing,
    clustering, classification, regression, visualization, and feature selection.
    All of Weka''s techniques are predicated on the assumption that the data is available
    as one flat file or relation, where each data point is described by a fixed number
    of attributes (normally, numeric or nominal attributes, but some other attribute
    types are also supported). Weka provides access to SQL databases using Java Database
    Connectivity and can process the result returned by a database query.'

  description: 'Scalable Data Anonymization Tool - supports multiple privacy models.


    ARX is a comprehensive open source software for anonymizing sensitive personal
    data. It supports a wide variety of (1) privacy and risk models, (2) methods for
    transforming data and (3) methods for analyzing the usefulness of output data.
    It supports various anonymization techniques, methods for analyzing data quality
    and re-identification risks and it supports well-known privacy models, such as
    k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness and differential privacy.

    ARX is an open source tool for transforming structured (i.e. tabular) personal
    data using selected methods from the broad areas of data anonymization and statistical
    disclosure control. It supports transforming datasets in ways that make sure that
    they adhere to user-specified privacy models and risk thresholds that mitigate
    attacks that may lead to privacy breaches. ARX can be used to remove direct identifiers
    (e.g. names) from datasets and to enforce further constraints on indirect identifiers.
    Indirect identifiers (or quasi-identifiers, or keys) are attributes that do not
    directly identify an individual but may together with other indirect identifiers
    form an identifier that can be used for linkage attacks. It is typically assumed
    that information about indirect identifiers is available to the attacker (in some
    form of background knowledge) and that they cannot simply be removed from the
    dataset (e.g. because they are required later for analyses).'

  description: 'SemEHR is a text mining and semantic search system designed for Surfacing
    Semantic Data from Clinical Notes in Electronic Health Records for Tailored Care,
    Trial Recruitment and Clinical Research.


    ### Results & Insights


    Built upon off-the-shelf toolkits including a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    pipeline (Bio-Yodie) and an enterprise search system (CogStack), SemEHR implements
    a generic information extraction (IE) and retrieval infrastructure by identifying
    contextualised mentions of a wide range of biomedical concepts from unstructured
    clinical notes. Its IE functionality features an adaptive and iterative NLP mechanism
    where specific requirements and fine-tuning can be fulfilled and realised on a
    study basis. NLP annotations are further assembled at patient level and extended
    with clinical and EHR-specific knowledge to populate a panorama for each patient,
    which comprises a) longitudinal semantic data views and b) structured medical
    profile(s). The semantic data is serviced via ontology-based search and analytics
    interfaces to facilitate clinical studies.'

  category: Corpus for NLP research
  description: Research literature in biomedicine and related fields contains a huge
    number of claims, such as the effectiveness of treatments. These claims are not
    always consistent and may even contradict each other. Being able to identify contradictory
    claims is important for those who rely on the biomedical literature. Automated
    methods to identify and resolve them are required to cope with the amount of information
    available. However, research in this area has been hampered by a lack of suitable
    resources. We provide a corpus containing examples of potentially contradictory
    claims from Medline abstracts describing cardiovascular research intended as a
    useful resource for researchers working on similar problems.

    \ etc. and calculate the daily dose. It also flags if the instructions specify\
    \ a dose range or state a maximum dose, or if it is an 'as required' prescription.\n\
    \nThe algorithm can be run as an R service and called from other applications\
    \ such as Python.  \n\nThe original version of the algorithm was in Visual Basic,\

    from free or semi-structured endoscopy reports and their associated pathology
    specimens.


    Gastroenterology now has many standards against which practice is measured although
    many reporting systems do not include the reporting capability to give anything
    more than basic analysis. Much of the data is locked in semi-structured text.
    However the nature of semi-structured text means that data can be extracted in
    a standardised way- it just requires more manipulation.


    This package provides that manipulation so that complex endoscopic-pathological
    analyses, in line with recognised standards for these analyses, can be done.'
