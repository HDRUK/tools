It contains several types of pulse waves (such as those measured by smart watches and fitness trackers) at common measurement sites for 4,374 virtual subjects aged 25 - 75 years old. The virtual subjects exhibit a range of cardiovascular properties across the normal ranges encountered in healthy people. The results were verified against in vivo data. Case studies were published (at https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019 ) demonstrating the utility of the database.\n\nThe database is a useful resource for research and education on the topics of: signal processing, physiology, and computational modelling.",

      "description": "Cytel Inc. has launched an open-access global COVID-19 Clinical Trial Tracker to help facilitate greater collaboration between researchers, policymakers, clinicians, journalists, philanthropists, and other critical stakeholders who need to understand the complex dynamics of the global response to finding a solution to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThis will enable them to make more informed and pragmatic decisions on how to channel scarce resources. Clinicians and local government need to know what trials are taking place in their community to ensure that the right patients receive the right exploratory treatment, while philanthropists and Federal policymakers deserve a one-stop shop to determine which are the most promising early phase treatment results.\n\nFunded in part by The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a leader in global health solutions, this live dashboard offers an overview of all the trials taking place in the international effort to tackle the pandemic. One of the most difficult challenges facing those seeking a COVID-19 treatment is how little data exists about this disease. Early investigators are relying on guesswork to determine which therapies to investigate. Collating information in one place on the growing numbers of trials, will enable decision-makers to compare treatments more easily as they determine which to investigate further.",

      "description": "Scalable Data Anonymization Tool - supports multiple privacy models.\n\nARX is a comprehensive open source software for anonymizing sensitive personal data. It supports a wide variety of (1) privacy and risk models, (2) methods for transforming data and (3) methods for analyzing the usefulness of output data. It supports various anonymization techniques, methods for analyzing data quality and re-identification risks and it supports well-known privacy models, such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness and differential privacy.\nARX is an open source tool for transforming structured (i.e. tabular) personal data using selected methods from the broad areas of data anonymization and statistical disclosure control. It supports transforming datasets in ways that make sure that they adhere to user-specified privacy models and risk thresholds that mitigate attacks that may lead to privacy breaches. ARX can be used to remove direct identifiers (e.g. names) from datasets and to enforce further constraints on indirect identifiers. Indirect identifiers (or quasi-identifiers, or keys) are attributes that do not directly identify an individual but may together with other indirect identifiers form an identifier that can be used for linkage attacks. It is typically assumed that information about indirect identifiers is available to the attacker (in some form of background knowledge) and that they cannot simply be removed from the dataset (e.g. because they are required later for analyses).",

      "description": "Tool to help prepare for ETLs of healthcare datasets.\n\nWhiteRabbit is a small application that can be used to analyze the structure and contents of a database as preparation for designing an ETL. It comes with RabbitInAHat, an application for interactive design of an ETL to the OMOP Common Data Model with the help of the scan report generated by White Rabbit. WhiteRabbit\u2019s main function is to perform a scan of the source data, providing detailed information on the tables, fields, and values that appear in a field. This scan will generate a report that can be used as a reference when designing the ETL, for instance by using the Rabbit-In-a-Hat tool. White Rabbit differs from standard data profiling tools in that it attempts to prevent the display of personally identifiable information (PII) data values in the generated output data file.",

For example, it can extract information about a patient and the illnesses they are suffering from letters written by their doctor. \n\nThis information can then be used in several ways. It tells us about the patient on an individual level, and by presenting findings in a better way, it allows doctors to make more informed decisions about their care. It also tells us about the illnesses that patients have, and what patients who have those diseases are like. This information contributes to our overall knowledge of medicine, and will help to improve overall procedures and treatments for many patients.\n\n### Results & Insights\n\n* Application of formal logics to text mining\n* General heuristics for context disambiguation\n* Ontology construction\n* Medical cohort identification\n* Literature mining\n* Medical outcome prediction and decision making support",

Much of the data is locked in semi-structured text. However the nature of semi-structured text means that data can be extracted in a standardised way- it just requires more manipulation.\n\nThis package provides that manipulation so that complex endoscopic-pathological analyses, in line with recognised standards for these analyses, can be done.",

Markup also allows users to synthetically create their own training data to train machine learning and active learning models that generate annotation suggestions to the user. Current ML algorithms include Random Forest and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM). Markup produces standoff format annotations so that annotations can be used with other software i.e. GATE.\n\n### Results & Insights\n\nPaper currently under review.",

The second questionnaire builds on the first and includes neighbourhood issues, domestic violence, alcohol use, healthcare, thoughts on the lockdown and new connections made during the pandemic. The group continues to expand the questionnaire bank as the pandemic unfolds.  \n\nThe questionnaire is freely available and to use it simply get in touch via email:\u202f wellcomecovid-19@bristol.ac.uk.\n\nThe questionnaires have been developed with the input of many individuals and longitudinal studies, contributing time to create, collect and analyse data.\n\n\n\n### Results & Insights\n\nInsights can be explored at https://www.closer.ac.uk/covid19-longitudinal-research-hub/\n\nPublications arising will be added in due course",

Secondary analyses found increased risk of CVST after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (4.01, 2.08 to 7.71 at 8-14 days), after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (3.58, 1.39 to 9.27 at 15-21 days), and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; increased risk of ischaemic stroke after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.12, 1.04 to 1.20 at 15-21 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; and increased risk of other rare arterial thrombotic events after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.21, 1.02 to 1.43 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSION: Increased risks of haematological and vascular events that led to hospital admission or death were observed for short time intervals after first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. The risks of most of these events were substantially higher and more prolonged after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination in the same population.",

Owing to the privatised nature of the water industry in the United Kingdom, the required catchment area datasets are not readily available to researchers. Here, we present a consolidated dataset of 7,537 catchment areas from ten sewerage service providers in the Great Britain, covering more than 96% of the population of England and Wales. We develop a geospatial method for estimating the population resident within each catchment from small area population estimates generated by the Office for National Statistics. The method is more widely applicable to matching electronic health records to wastewater infrastructure. Population estimates are highly predictive of population equivalent treatment loads reported under the European Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive. We highlight challenges associated with using geospatial data for wastewater-based epidemiology.",
